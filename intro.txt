# Et-GWAS

The Et-GWAS method leverages historical recombination events within a diversity panel to identify rare, high-impact variants associated with the targeted traits. Inspired by the extreme-phenotype GWAS approach, it combines bulk segregant analysis with GWAS, treating the diversity panel as a segregating population. The method uses available genome sequence information to construct extreme pools and a random bulk, representing the genomic variation across the entire diversity panel. The contrasting germplasms are grouped, and allele frequencies are measured to facilitate the detection of marker-trait associations (MTAs). To illustrate the Et-GWAS, we presented a schematic representation in Figure 1, focusing on its application to yield under reproductive stage drought in rice. The analysis involves the following three key steps: 

    1. Sampling: Constructing the diversity panel and bulk preparation based on the trait distribution.
    2. Pooling: Combine the sequence data from the bulks and Quantitative measurement of pooled allele frequency.
    3. Screening: Association analysis and identification of donors with top performing haplotypes

## Graphical user interphase and stand-alone package of Et-GWAS 
The Et-GWAS application is user-friendly and requires no prior knowledge of R programming. It operates through a graphical user interface (GUI) that guides users through the process. To begin, users input the desired bulk size, trait name, and phenotypic file on the starting page of the application. Comprehensive instructions regarding data formatting can be found in the documentation below. It can be assessed through  https://et-gwas.shinyapps.io/Et-GWAS/. The functionality of the pipeline and test results are displayed in Figure 2, demonstrating its effectiveness in trait association studies. It is important to note that the Et-GWAS application hosted on the server has a limit of handling 30K markers.  

To accommodate higher marker coverage (5,82,721 SNPs), we recommend launching the application locally by running the code “shiny::runGitHub(“Et-GWAS”, “IRRISouthAsiaHub”)”  in RStudio. This allows for a broader marker range, enhancing the precision and scope of trait discovery and association analysis. For smooth run, it requires a workstation with the memory of 64 GB or above and a CPU speed of 3.0GHz or above.

Figure 2 Main interface of the Et-GWAS application. Screenshots of panels for the main tabs are shown. (a) The “Phenotype” tab displays the phenotypic distribution of the given panel. (b) The “Population structure” tab allows users to visualize the subpopulation structure of the panel. By default 3 principal components are calculated. (c) The “Phenotypic distribution” tab allows users to visualize the phenotypic distribution in each bulk. The users have the flexibility to choose the bulk size according to their panel size. (d) The “Association” tab generates Manhattan plot with two significant values (10-4 & 10-6). Rest of the plots and tables will be generated and kept in a zip file which users can download using the right panel “Download” button at the end of the analysis.
